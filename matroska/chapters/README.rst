Chapter test data
=================
Test data for chapter support in mpv. Feel free to make more demented cases as
you see fit :) . Failure cases welcome:

  - not finding a suitable source;
  - requested chapter boundary too long;
  - timeline merging (and the wrong chapter times this can create)

Generating the videos
=====================
The videos are generated by the ``mkvideos.sh`` script which first generates
simple images of a single color. These are then referenced by various other
videos with the name of a country. That video has a chapter for each color and
references that colored file. This reference doesn't use an edition UID at
all. Next, a video for each continent is created which references the country
videos by segment and edition. Lastly, a ``world.mkv`` file is generated which
references each continent file by segment and edition.

This should test the trickier parts of the feature.

Groups
======
There are a few groups of videos in here:

  - ``standard``:  expected to work without any issues
  - ``start-after-end``: all parts should be missing because the country
    videos reference the color videos starting after their ends
  - ``end-after-end``: should play fine, but there should be missing time
    because the color videos are shorter than requested from the country
    videos (the end timeline should look just like ``standard``)
